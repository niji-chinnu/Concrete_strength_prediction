# Concrete_strength_prediction
Linear,DEsicion Tree,Random forest, kNN, and SVM Models are created to predict the concrete strength 

The model is built to predict the concrete Strength based on the given features

The data is cleaned by removing outliers and and null values

The multi colinear features are removed using RFE 

Cross validation and hyper pameter tunning is done on different models to find out the best model 

Conclusion:After hyperparameter tunning and cross validation we found out SVm as good model as it gives 65% accuracy
